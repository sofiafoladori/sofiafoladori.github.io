      <description>Scientific publications on the subject of “democratization of science” were examined, showing the temporal and thematic patterns in two databases. Scientific publications, in all areas of knowledge, are concentrated in developed countries, which also hold economic power, the most prestigious universities, and the most widely distributed scientific journals.

In this project, we examine the Web of Science database, international and mostly in English, and SciELO, an Ibero-American database, where publications in Spanish and Portuguese are mainly concentrated.</description>
