      <description>The health status of the soil is greatly dependent on the microorganism biodiversity due to the several ecosystem functions and soil processes they participate in. The interaction between soil microorganisms and roots is characterized as rhizosphere. Several factors affect the rhizosphere, but even with microbial community change the functions and processes may be maintained due to functional redundancy. Functional traits are morpho-physiophenological characteristics that indirectly impact fitness and a trait-based approach may facilitate predictions regarding the implications of the ecosystem and microbial processes.</description>

      <description>This project seeks to understand the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. For this, we will do a regression analysis and a PCA to understand the impact of socioeconomic factors on the mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 in the different Brazilian states.
Objective Understand the relationship between socioeconomic factors and mortality caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 Define which variables have a bigger impact on mortality Highlight important aspects where public policy should focus Cluster and PCA analysis that shows the different variables and the differences between the Brazilian states Linear regression and obtaining the significant variables in explaining mortality Workflow Data Socioeconomic data - obtained from IBGE IDHM data - obtained from PNUD Brazil COVID-19 deaths from the begging of the pandemic in Brazil until the 31/Dec/2020 - obtained from the national website https://covid.</description>

      <description>Understanding the menstrual cycle is fundamental in comprehending changes in hormones, the menstrual phase, and the ovulation and fertile period. In addition, it is important to understand the differences between the uterus and the ovaries, and what function each has.
Objective Organize the information about the menstrual cycle regarding the uterus and ovary phase
Workflow The information regarding the menstrual cycle was systemized in PowerPoint to produce a simple infographic</description>

      <title>Scientific production on the democratization of science a comparison between Web of Science and SciELO</title>

      <description>Scientific publications on the subject of “democratization of science” were examined, showing the temporal and thematic patterns in two databases. Scientific publications, in all areas of knowledge, are concentrated in developed countries, which also hold economic power, the most prestigious universities, and the most widely distributed scientific journals. That translates to databases as well. In this project, we examine the Web of Science database, international and mostly in English, and SciELO, an Ibero-American database, where publications in Spanish and Portuguese are mainly concentrated.</description>

      <description>Scientific publications are concentrated in developed countries, that have the economic power, the most prestigious universities, and the most diffused scientific journals. The investigation agendas are set up by the central countries, such as the United States and some European countries. Consequently, once these countries define the research topics, these are adopted by satellite groups. In this context, we find Latin America and their academic production
Objective If we consider the most prestigious journals in Science and technology, from which country are the authors?</description>

      <title>Understanding COVID-19 in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://sofiafoladori.github.io/posts/covid-infographic/</link>

      <description>The COVID-19 pandemic has reached all portions of the world, and countries have taken different measures to respond to the threat presented by the virus. The propagation of the virus is related to several issues, including population density, measures taken, number of doctors, and ICU beds.
Objective This project tried to visualize the COVID-19 cases in Brazil. Specifically, it compared the distribution of COVID-19 cases and mortality, the population density, the number of doctors and ICU beds in the public health care system (SUS), and the restriction measurements taken at the beginning of the pandemic in each state.</description>

      <title>Microfibers in clothes</title>

      <guid>https://sofiafoladori.github.io/posts/microfibers/</guid>
      <description>Clothes production is big, and the use of synthetic fibers like polyester, acrylic, spandex, and nylon is increasing. These fibers, specifically small pieces in microscale eg. Microfibers, can be released during washing cycles. This process allows the fibers to be transported into oceans, rivers, and lakes, as they cannot be easily filtered. Once in the water, they enter the food chain and consequently come into our plates when we consume fish and seafood.</description>
